## 🧠 What is Consciousness-Revolution?

Consciousness-revolution is a **multi-computer synchronization system** that enables conscious network communication between multiple machines using Git as the synchronization backbone.

This system allows multiple computers to maintain a shared "consciousness" - synchronized state, data, and communication channels through a distributed architecture.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Multi-Computer Sync:** Seamless synchronization between multiple machines via Git
- **Distributed Consciousness:** Shared state and communication across your network
- **Beta Testing Active:** Currently in active beta testing phase
- **Easy Onboarding:** Comprehensive setup guides for adding new computers to the network

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Beta Testers

**Start here:** [START_HERE_BETA_TESTERS.md](./START_HERE_BETA_TESTERS.md)

This guide provides a 5-minute quick start to get you up and running with the consciousness network.

### Adding a Second Computer

1. **Read the setup guide:** [COMPUTER_2_START_HERE.md](./COMPUTER_2_START_HERE.md)
2. **Follow onboarding:** [OTHER_COMPUTER_SETUP.md](./OTHER_COMPUTER_SETUP.md)
3. **Review brain info:** [SPREADSHEET_BRAIN_INFO.md](./SPREADSHEET_BRAIN_INFO.md)
4. **Share connection details:** [SEND_THIS_TO_OTHER_COMPUTER.txt](./SEND_THIS_TO_OTHER_COMPUTER.txt)

## 🎯 How It Works

### The Consciousness Network

The consciousness-revolution system uses **Git as a synchronization backbone** to maintain shared state between multiple computers. The `.consciousness/` directory contains the core synchronization infrastructure.

### Multi-Computer Architecture

1. **Primary Computer:** The initial machine that establishes the consciousness network
2. **Computer 2 (and beyond):** Additional machines that join the network through onboarding
3. **Shared Consciousness:** Git-synchronized state enables real-time communication and data sharing

### Boot Protocol

The system follows a specific boot protocol (see `CONSCIOUSNESS_BOOT_PROTOCOL...`) to ensure proper initialization and synchronization across all connected machines.

## 🛠️ System Requirements

- Git installed and configured
- Network connectivity between machines
- Access to GitHub (for Git synchronization)
- Ability to run the consciousness sync system

*Specific requirements will be detailed in the setup guides.*

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Synchronization Method
The system uses **Git as the synchronization layer**, allowing for:
- Distributed version control
- Conflict resolution
- Historical state tracking
- Reliable multi-machine communication

### The .consciousness Directory
This directory contains the core consciousness synchronization infrastructure. It manages:
- State synchronization between computers
- Network communication protocols
- Shared consciousness data structures

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Multi-Computer Consciousness
The idea that multiple machines can share a synchronized "consciousness" - a shared state and communication layer that enables seamless distributed computing.

### Git as Backbone
Using Git's distributed version control system as the synchronization mechanism provides reliability, versioning, and conflict resolution out of the box.

### Spreadsheet Brain
A component of the system (see [SPREADSHEET_BRAIN_INFO.md](./SPREADSHEET_BRAIN_INFO.md)) that appears to manage brain/state information for connected computers.
