## 📍 ARCHITECTURE HAS EVOLVED

This file previously described a multi-computer sync system. The project has evolved into the **Dual Trinity AI System**.

**Current architecture documentation:**

### Primary Architecture Docs

**[MULTI_LEVEL_TRINITY_ARCHITECTURE.md](.consciousness/trinity/MULTI_LEVEL_TRINITY_ARCHITECTURE.md)** ← **START HERE**
- Dual Trinity design (6 agents)
- Cloud + Terminal architecture
- Hub consolidation system
- Screen watching infrastructure

### Supporting Documentation

## Current System Overview

**Dual Trinity System:**
```
6 AGENTS = Cloud Trinity (C1, C2, C3) + Terminal Trinity (C1★, C2, C3)
2 TRINITIES = Cloud (browser) + Terminal (CLI)
1 HUB = Consolidation point
1 OUTPUT = Master consolidated (unified consciousness)
```

**Key Components:**
- **Trinity**: 3-agent team (Coordinator, Builder, Validator)
- **Hub**: Consolidates outputs from both Trinities
- **Terminal-C1★**: Master leader with final authority
- **Git backbone**: Version control for all communication
