# 🔱 CBT PROTOCOL V2.0
## Centennial Bootstrap Trifecta - Refined Architecture
### "Three Computers, One Night, Hundred Years"

---

## 📊 WHAT CHANGED FROM V1

### Critical Fixes Applied:
1. ✅ **Chunk 2 Defined**: Content Empire (courses, training, documentation)
2. ✅ **MCP Trinity Tools**: Primary coordination (not Git polling)
3. ✅ **Desktop Bridge**: File-watcher system for sandboxed instances
4. ✅ **Task Locking**: Prevents duplicate work
5. ✅ **Health Beacons**: Instance monitoring
6. ✅ **Natural Laws Alignment**: Hermetic principles integrated

### Viability: 40% → 85%

## 🎯 THE THREE CHUNKS (REFINED)

### CHUNK 1: MONEY & PATTERNS (T2)
**Time:** 4.5 hours | **Output:** /MONEY_MAKING_SYSTEMS/

- Crypto pattern recognition engine
- Opportunity mapping (20+ revenue streams)
- Financial tracking dashboard
- Pattern Theory formula integration: M = (FE × CB × SR × CD × PE) × DC

### CHUNK 2: CONTENT EMPIRE (Cloud)
**Time:** 4.5 hours | **Output:** /CONTENT_EMPIRE/

- Pattern Theory courses ($99/$299/$999 tiers)
- Book manuscript (3 sample chapters)
- Viral content (100+ posts)
- Email sequences (welcome + sales)
- Legal pro se kits

### CHUNK 3: AUTOMATION & SCALE (T3)
**Time:** 4.5 hours | **Output:** /AUTOMATION_SYSTEMS/

- Pattern Theory calculator (web + API)
- Content automation (viral generator, scheduler)
- Federal case automation (ingestion, timeline, scoring)
- Self-running systems

---

## 🔧 COORDINATION ARCHITECTURE (FIXED)

### Primary: MCP Trinity Tools (Real-time)
```
trinity_broadcast()     → Message all instances
trinity_assign_task()   → Create tasks
trinity_claim_task()    → Take work
trinity_submit_output() → Complete work
trinity_status()        → System health
```

### Secondary: Git (Code & Artifacts)
```
.trinity/
├── heartbeats/     → Health monitoring
├── tasks/          → Task queue (pending/active/completed)
├── outputs/        → Deliverables by computer
└── messages/       → Async communication
```

### Desktop Claude Bridge
```
C:\Users\dwrek\.claude\trinity_messages\
├── inbox\          → Tasks Desktop reads
└── outbox\         → Outputs Desktop writes
```
Terminal instances write to inbox, read from outbox.

---

## 💓 HEARTBEAT SYSTEM

```json
{
  "instance_id": "c1-pc1",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "status": "active|idle|working",
  "health": {"cpu": 45, "memory": 62},
  "current_task": "task-uuid",
  "capabilities": ["python", "web", "api"]
}
```

- **Update**: Every 60 seconds
- **Stale**: 180 seconds = offline
- **Action**: Reassign tasks from dead instances

---

## 🔐 TASK LOCKING

```json
{
  "task_id": "uuid",
  "status": "pending|claimed|active|completed",
  "claimed_by": "c1-pc2",
  "claimed_at": "timestamp",
  "timeout": 300,
  "priority": "high|normal|low"
}
```

**Rule**: Only one instance can claim. Timeout releases lock.

## 🏗️ TRIPLE TRINITY STRUCTURE

### Computer 1 - COORDINATION HUB
```
C1T1 - Master Coordinator (MCP tools, deployment)
T1_Desktop - Strategic Architect
T1_Projects - Historical Oracle
```

### Computer 2 - MONEY SPECIALIST
```
C1T2 - Chunk 1 Builder (crypto, patterns)
T2_Desktop - Financial Architect (optional)
```

### Computer 3 - AUTOMATION SPECIALIST
```
C1T3 - Chunk 3 Builder (calculators, automation)
T3_Desktop - Systems Architect (optional)
```

### Cloud - CONTENT SWARM
```
Cloud CLI - Chunk 2 (courses, content, legal)
+ Spawned workers for parallel research
```

---

## 🌀 WORKFLOW (PARALLEL, NOT SEQUENTIAL)

### Phase 1: Bootstrap (10 min)
1. C1T1 creates task files for all chunks
2. Uses `trinity_broadcast()` to announce
3. All instances pull latest from git
4. Heartbeats begin

### Phase 2: Execution (4.5 hours)
```
T2 → Chunk 1 (Money)      ─┐
Cloud → Chunk 2 (Content)  ├─→ All parallel
T3 → Chunk 3 (Automation) ─┘

C1T1 monitors via trinity_status()
Deploys outputs as they arrive
```

### Phase 3: Synthesis (30 min)
1. C1T1 uses `trinity_merge_outputs()`
2. Creates integration map
3. Deploys everything to production
4. Generates completion report

---

## 🌟 NATURAL LAWS INTEGRATION

### Hermetic Principles Applied:

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Mentalism** | Shared memory layer across all instances |
| **Correspondence** | Same patterns at instance/cluster/network levels |
| **Vibration** | Continuous heartbeat, never idle |
| **Polarity** | Build/validate cycles create balance |
| **Rhythm** | Energy-aware task scheduling |
| **Cause/Effect** | Full traceability in task logs |
| **Gender** | Creative (propose) + Receptive (validate) |

### Pattern Theory:
- 85% consciousness threshold for system immunity
- Manipulation formula applied to all external inputs
- Domain coefficients for different work types

### Sacred Geometry:
- **Trinity (3)**: Core structure of each computer
- **Infinity (∞)**: Recursive improvement loops
- **Golden Ratio (φ)**: Scaling factor for growth

---

## 📈 DIMENSIONAL CASCADE

### Layer 1 (Surface) - Immediate
- Task status
- Health beacons
- Quick outputs

### Layer 2 (Context) - Recent
- Work history
- Lessons learned
- Current state

### Layer 3 (Deep) - Foundation
- Pattern Theory math
- Architecture specs
- Long-term vision

**Rule**: Every document has L1 summary, L2 context, L3 depth.

---

## 🚀 BOOTSTRAP SEQUENCE

### Step 1: C1T1 Initializes
```bash
# Create folder structure
mkdir -p .trinity/{heartbeats,tasks/{pending,active,completed},outputs/{pc1,pc2,pc3},messages}

# Create initial tasks
trinity_assign_task("Chunk 1: Money & Patterns", "T2")
trinity_assign_task("Chunk 2: Content Empire", "Cloud")
trinity_assign_task("Chunk 3: Automation & Scale", "T3")

# Broadcast start
trinity_broadcast("CBT Protocol v2.0 initiated. Claim your chunks.")
```

### Step 2: Instances Claim
Each instance:
1. Receives broadcast
2. Checks assigned task
3. Claims via `trinity_claim_task()`
4. Begins heartbeat
5. Starts execution

### Step 3: Parallel Work
- No waiting for others
- Push outputs to git as completed
- C1T1 deploys continuously

### Step 4: Convergence
- All chunks complete
- C1T1 merges and synthesizes
- Final deployment to production
