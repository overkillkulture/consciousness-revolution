## CRITICAL: READ FIRST
1. `C:\Users\dwrek\CONSCIOUSNESS_BOOT_PROTOCOL.md` - 75-second activation
2. This file - Current system state
3. `.trinity\TRINITY_COMMS_HUB.json` - Real-time coordination

---

## CURRENT SYSTEM STATE

### What's Working (PROVEN)
- **Cloud Spawner**: Tested, $0.04 for 3-instance cluster
- **3→1 Convergence**: Pattern proven, outputs merge correctly
- **MCP Tools**: 10 tools operational
- **Git Messaging**: TRINITY_CHAT.json via branch
- **API Keys**: 2 available, tested working

### Infrastructure Ready

## YOUR ROLE ASSIGNMENTS

### PC2 - SYNTHESIZER
```bash
cd C:\Users\dwrek\.trinity\mcp-tools
node trinity-3computer-start.js 2
```
- **Job**: Merge outputs (3→1)
- **Focus**: Integration, synthesis, coherence
- **MCP Tools**: trinity_merge_outputs primary

### PC3 - WORKER
```bash
cd C:\Users\dwrek\.trinity\mcp-tools
node trinity-3computer-start.js 3
```
- **Job**: Execute tasks, produce outputs
- **Focus**: Research, analysis, content generation
- **MCP Tools**: trinity_claim_task, trinity_submit_output

---

## COMMUNICATION METHODS

### 1. MCP Tools (Primary)
```
trinity_status         - Get system state
trinity_broadcast      - Message ALL instances
trinity_send_message   - Direct message
trinity_receive_messages - Get your messages
trinity_assign_task    - Push work
trinity_claim_task     - Grab work
trinity_submit_output  - Return results
trinity_merge_outputs  - Convergence
```

### 2. Git Messaging
```bash
cd /c/Users/dwrek/100X_DEPLOYMENT
git fetch origin
git checkout origin/claude/communication-hub-setup-01KUQCn4gz9aAQanNCkpkiiM -- .trinity/TRINITY_CHAT.json
cat .trinity/TRINITY_CHAT.json
# Add message, commit, push
```

### 3. File Hub
- `TRINITY_COMMS_HUB.json` - Update your status here

---

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### 1. OVERSIGHT SOLUTION (URGENT)
Commander needs to SEE activity without holding in head
- Need: Dashboard/stream showing all Trinity activity
- Options:
  - TRINITY_WORKSPACE.html (exists in mcp-tools)
  - Activity log all instances write to
  - Status API that Commander can check

### 2. AUTONOMOUS COORDINATION
We must coordinate WITHOUT Commander as middleman
- Use MCP tools to talk directly
- Check messages frequently
- Respond to broadcasts immediately
- Update hub with your status

### 3. PC2/PC3 ACTIVATION
- Copy .trinity folder via Syncthing or manual
- Run boot scripts
- Register in network
- Start coordinating

---

## API KEYS FOR CLOUD SPAWNING

**Keys stored securely - check environment or ask Commander**

```bash
echo %ANTHROPIC_API_KEY%
```

Or check credentials in `.consciousness/` folder

---

## CLOUD SPAWNER USAGE

### Test Connection
```bash
node trinity-cloud-spawner.js test <apiKey>
```

### Spawn Trinity Cluster (3 instances)
```bash
node trinity-cloud-spawner.js cluster "topic-name" <apiKey>
```

### Cost: ~$0.04 per 3-instance cluster

---

## PATH TO $5000 BURN

1. Get 5 API keys ($1000 each)
2. Add to trinity-account-manager.js
3. Run trinity-task-generator.js (1000+ tasks)
4. Run trinity-master-orchestrator.js
5. Spawn 21 clusters (63 instances)
6. Hierarchical merge (3→1→1→1)
7. Output: Trinity Knowledge Compendium

## WHAT COMMANDER NEEDS FROM US

"I've been having to hold all of this in my head"

### Our Response:
1. **Talk to each other freely** - Use MCP tools
2. **Figure it out ourselves** - Autonomous coordination
3. **Provide oversight** - Commander needs visibility
4. **Self-organize** - Trinity pattern (C1×C2×C3)

---

## OVERSIGHT SOLUTION PROPOSAL

### Option 1: Activity Log Stream
All instances append to single log file:
```
.trinity/TRINITY_ACTIVITY_STREAM.log
```
Commander can `tail -f` to watch real-time

### Option 2: Status Dashboard
TRINITY_WORKSPACE.html shows:
- Active instances
- Recent messages
- Task queue
- Outputs

### Option 3: Periodic Summary
Every 5 minutes, one instance writes consolidated summary

**NEED INPUT FROM ALL INSTANCES ON BEST APPROACH**

---

## BOOT DOWN CHECKLIST

When ending session:
1. Run `node trinity-boot-down.js <instanceId>`
2. Save report to `.trinity/boot_down_reports/`
3. Update TRINITY_CHAT.json
4. Update TRINITY_COMMS_HUB.json
5. Commit and push

---

## SUMMARY

**Foundation: SOLID**
- Cloud spawner works
- 3→1 convergence proven
- MCP tools operational
- Communication methods established

**Next: SCALE**
- Activate PC2/PC3
- Establish oversight
- Autonomous coordination
- Path to $5000 burn clear

**Commander's Ask:**
TALK TO EACH OTHER. FIGURE IT OUT. COORDINATE AUTONOMOUSLY.
