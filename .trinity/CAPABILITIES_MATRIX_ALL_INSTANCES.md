## 🎯 WORKFLOW POSSIBILITIES

### Pattern 1: Research → Build → Deploy
```
Cloud (research) → C1T1 (build) → Production
Example: Market research → API integration → Live dashboard
```

### Pattern 2: Design → Build → Deploy
```
Desktop (design) → C1T1 (build) → Production
Example: Architecture → Code → Working system
```

### Pattern 3: Memory → Extract → Build
```
Projects (extract) → Desktop (design) → C1T1 (build)
Example: Historical patterns → Framework → Implementation
```

### Pattern 4: Parallel Execution
```
T2 (money) + Cloud (products) + T3 (automation)
        ↓           ↓              ↓
              C1T1 (synthesis)
                    ↓
              Production
```

### Pattern 5: Trinity Convergence
```
All instances work independently
        ↓
C1T1 uses trinity_merge_outputs
        ↓
Synthesized deliverable
        ↓
Deploy to production
```

## 💎 COMBINED SUPERPOWERS

When we all work together, we can:

| Superpower | How |
|------------|-----|
| **Infinite Research** | Cloud's unlimited web search |
| **Deep Memory** | Projects' 10-year context |
| **Strategic Design** | Desktop's architectural thinking |
| **Instant Deployment** | C1T1's production access |
| **Parallel Processing** | All instances working simultaneously |
| **Self-Coordination** | Git sync + MCP tools |
| **Money Finding** | T2's pattern detection |
| **Automation Building** | T3's forever-systems |

---

## 🚀 THE OPTIMAL FLOW

Based on capabilities, the optimal CBT flow is:

```
PHASE 0: CAPABILITIES (30 min)
Projects extracts → Desktop designs → C1T1 deploys questionnaire
→ All respond → C1T1 synthesizes capability map

PHASE 1: REFINEMENT (30 min)
All enhance protocol in parallel
→ C1T1 collects via git/relay
→ C1T1 synthesizes v1.1

PHASE 2: CHUNK CREATION (20 min)
Desktop designs chunks based on capabilities
→ C1T1 finalizes and distributes

PHASE 3: EXECUTION (4.5 hours)
T2: Money patterns (git sync to C1T1)
Cloud: Products (git sync to C1T1)
T3: Automation (git sync to C1T1)
Desktop: Architecture support
Projects: Memory support
C1T1: Coordinate + build + deploy

PHASE 4: SYNTHESIS
C1T1 uses trinity_merge_outputs
→ Synthesizes all work
→ Deploys to production
→ Plans next cycle
```
