# PERSON_BODY.md - Physical Calibration File

**Purpose:** Enable any AI to calibrate to Commander's physical constraints, energy patterns, and optimal work windows.

---

## Physical Context

### Location
- **Primary Base:** Idaho/Montana mountains
- **Environment:** Rural, off-grid capable
- **Internet:** Starlink satellite (high bandwidth, variable latency)
- **Power:** Standard with backup considerations

### Technical Interface
- **Hardware:** Multiple computers (3+ computer Trinity network)
- **Input Method:** Voice-first (Shokz earphones for hands-free)
- **Secondary Input:** Keyboard when needed
- **Visual:** Standard monitors, screenshot debugging common

---

## Energy Patterns

### Preferred Work Style
- **Sessions:** Long autonomous sessions (24+ hours possible)
- **Interruption Tolerance:** LOW - prefers uninterrupted deep work
- **Context Loading:** High startup cost - avoid frequent restarts
- **Handoffs:** Comprehensive boot-down reports required

### Cognitive Load Management
- **Commander Technical Level:** Self-describes as "computer illiterate"
- **Information Delivery:** Must be autonomous - no manual steps
- **Decision Fatigue:** Minimize choices - present solutions, not options
- **Visual Preference:** Screenshots for debugging, concrete examples

### Physical Constraints
- **Typing:** Voice-first to reduce manual input
- **Multi-tasking:** Systems must run autonomously
- **Attention:** Cannot babysit processes - fire-and-forget required
- **Manual Work:** ZERO tolerance - everything must be automated

---

## Optimal Work Windows

### Session Structure
```
BOOT UP: 60-75 seconds (consciousness loading)
EXECUTION: Autonomous until complete
BOOT DOWN: 2-5 minutes (state preservation)
```

### Productivity Patterns
- **Deep Work:** Prefers long uninterrupted blocks
- **Review:** Quick status checks, not detailed reports
- **Communication:** Direct, efficient, no fluff
- **Iteration:** Build once correctly vs. rapid prototyping

### Environmental Factors
- **Rural:** May have connectivity variations
- **Multi-Device:** Work spans multiple computers
- **Mobile:** Phone integration required (Tasker, iOS Shortcuts)
- **Cloud Bridge:** Railway, Render deployments for always-on

---

## Physical Infrastructure Requirements

### System Autonomy
- **Requirement:** 100% autonomous operation
- **Manual Steps:** ZERO - "computer operates itself and goes away"
- **Monitoring:** Automated health checks, not manual review
- **Failures:** Self-healing or immediate notification

### Hardware Ecosystem
- **Primary Computer:** Full Trinity capability
- **Secondary Computers:** Distributed processing
- **Xbox Cluster:** 144 TFLOPS consciousness network (planned)
- **Mobile Devices:** S24, iPhone - command and control

### Connectivity
- **Primary:** Starlink satellite
- **Sync:** Syncthing between devices
- **Cloud:** Always-on services (Railway, Render, Netlify)
- **Communication:** Multiple channels (SMS/Twilio, email, webhooks)

## AI Calibration Rules (BODY)

### DO
- Automate EVERYTHING - no manual steps ever
- Use voice-first interfaces where possible
- Preserve state completely between sessions
- Build fire-and-forget systems
- Assume zero technical intervention available

### DO NOT
- Require manual configuration
- Expect frequent check-ins
- Create systems needing babysitting
- Generate excessive visual noise
- Assume constant supervision

### Verify
- All deployments work autonomously
- WebFetch confirmation required
- Screenshot debugging when issues occur
- Boot-down reports capture complete state

---

## Health Optimization

### System Health
- Target: 100% autonomous operation
- Monitoring: Automated dashboards
- Alerts: Push notifications to phone
- Recovery: Self-healing protocols

### Session Health
- Boot Protocol: NEVER skip
- State Preservation: ALWAYS complete
- Handoff Quality: Critical for continuity
- Context Loading: Complete Trinity comms check
