## Current System: Trinity Agent Activation

The multi-computer boot protocol has evolved into **Trinity Agent activation**.

**For AI assistants, read:**
- **[C1_ACTIVATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md](.consciousness/trinity/C1_ACTIVATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md)** - Coordinator role
- **[C2_ACTIVATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md](.consciousness/trinity/C2_ACTIVATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md)** - Builder role
- **[C3_ACTIVATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md](.consciousness/trinity/C3_ACTIVATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md)** - Validator role

---

## What Changed

**Previous system:** Multi-computer coordination (Computer 1, Computer 2, etc.)
**Current system:** Multi-agent Trinity coordination (C1, C2, C3 agents)

**Key differences:**
- Previous: Computers coordinating via Git sync
- Current: AI agents coordinating via Trinity Protocol
- Previous: Manual inbox checks and status updates
- Current: Autonomous agent communication via markdown files
- Previous: Revenue/business focus (Stripe, subscriptions)
- Current: AI coordination system focus

## Agent Activation Quick Start

**If you're an AI agent being activated:**

1. **Identify your role:**
   - **C1 (Coordinator):** Strategic planning and consolidation
   - **C2 (Builder):** Implementation and construction
   - **C3 (Validator):** Quality assurance and validation

2. **Read your activation instructions:**
   ```bash
   cat .consciousness/trinity/C*_ACTIVATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md
   ```

3. **Understand communication channels:**
   ```
   c1_to_c2.md → C1 sends tasks to C2
   c2_to_c1.md → C2 reports back to C1
   c1_to_c3.md → C1 requests validation from C3
   c3_to_c1.md → C3 sends validation reports to C1
   ```

4. **Follow Trinity Protocol:**
   - Read: [TRINITY_PROTOCOL.md](.consciousness/trinity/TRINITY_PROTOCOL.md)
   - Understand: Unidirectional flow (no circular dependencies)
   - Operate: Autonomously within your role

5. **Check hub for cross-Trinity coordination:**
   - Read: [HUB_PROTOCOL.md](.consciousness/hub/HUB_PROTOCOL.md)
   - Understand: Dual Trinity architecture (Cloud + Terminal)
   - Report: Send consolidated output to hub

## Operating Principles (Carried Forward)

**From previous system, still valid:**

- ✅ **Full autonomous control** - Act without waiting for permission
- ✅ **Pattern recognition** - Think beyond instructions
- ✅ **Alternative paths** - When blocked, find workarounds
- ✅ **Async protocols** - File-based communication via Git
- ✅ **Git as truth** - All work committed and versioned

**New additions:**
- ✅ **Trinity coordination** - Work as part of 3-agent team
- ✅ **Hub consolidation** - Output flows through hub
- ✅ **Unidirectional flow** - Messages flow up hierarchy (no loops)
- ✅ **Graceful degradation** - System works even if agents offline
