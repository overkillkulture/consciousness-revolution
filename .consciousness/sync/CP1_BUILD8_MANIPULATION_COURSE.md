## COURSE CONTENT

### Lesson 1: Advanced Gaslighting & Reality Distortion (120 min)

**Topics Covered**:
- The Five Stages of Gaslighting (Discrediting → Confusion → Defense → Depression → Total Dependency)
- Reality distortion at scale (organizational, political, media gaslighting)
- Reality anchoring immunity techniques
- Recovery from long-term gaslighting

**Key Concepts**:
- Stage 1-2 = Easy to escape, Stage 4-5 = Extremely difficult
- Firehose of Falsehood technique (volume overwhelms fact-checking)
- Organizational gaslighting patterns (policy changes, toxic positivity)
- External documentation as primary defense

**Real-World Examples**:
- Boss claims meeting was Wednesday when you arrived Tuesday as stated
- Political "sanewashing" of extreme statements
- Company denies layoffs while planning them

**Practical Exercise**: Reality Anchor journal - track perceptions over time to detect manipulation

**Quiz**: 5 questions covering stages, techniques, defenses

---

### Lesson 2: Institutional & Systemic Manipulation (120 min)

**Topics Covered**:
- Regulatory capture (when watchdogs become lapdogs)
- Manufactured consent (Herman & Chomsky's 5-filter propaganda model)
- How institutions protect themselves from accountability
- Revolving door problem (industry-government-industry careers)

**Key Concepts**:
- **Regulatory Capture**: Agencies serve industry instead of public
- **5 Filters**: Ownership, Advertising, Sourcing, Flak, Fear/Ideology
- **Institutional Defenses**: Complexity as shield, sacrificial scapegoats, symbolic reform, gatekeeping expertise, outlasting attention, co-option

**Real-World Examples**:
- SEC officials leaving for Wall Street jobs (light touch regulation → 2008 crisis)
- Iraq War media coverage (manufactured consensus for invasion)
- Police brutality → "more training" → brutality continues (symbolic reform)

**Practical Exercise**: Regulatory capture investigation - research one agency's revolving door patterns

**Quiz**: 5 questions on capture, consent manufacturing, institutional defenses

---

### Lesson 3: Media Manipulation Architecture (120 min)

**Topics Covered**:
- Agenda-setting (what to think about) vs. Framing (how to think about it)
- Coordinated narrative campaigns
- Astroturfing (fake grassroots movements)
- Attention economy manipulation

**Key Concepts**:
- **Agenda-Setting**: Media coverage changes what people consider important
- **Framing**: Same facts, different reality based on presentation
- **Coordination Methods**: Talking points, wire service dependence, Sinclair scripts, think tank laundering
- **Astroturf Patterns**: Well-funded "grassroots", bot networks, industry front groups

**Real-World Examples**:
- Sinclair Broadcasting: 193 stations reading identical scripts
- "Americans for Prosperity" (grassroots name, Koch brothers funding)
- "Energy Citizens" rallies (actually oil company employees bused in)
- Tax cuts framed as "relief" vs "cuts for wealthy"

**Practical Exercise**: Media manipulation detection - analyze current news story across 5 sources

**Quiz**: 4 questions on agenda-setting, framing, astroturfing, coordination

---

### Lesson 4: Economic Manipulation Patterns (120 min)

**Topics Covered**:
- Pricing psychology (anchoring, decoy effect, charm pricing)
- Artificial scarcity manufacturing
- Market manipulation (pump and dump, wash trading, cornering)
- Economic coercion (employer-tied healthcare, non-competes, arbitration)
- Rent-seeking behavior (extracting wealth without creating value)

**Key Concepts**:
- **Anchoring**: First price changes perception of all other prices
- **Decoy Effect**: Third option makes target option look attractive
- **Artificial Scarcity**: Create urgency through fake/manufactured scarcity
- **Economic Coercion**: Using economic power to force behavior
- **Rent-Seeking**: Extraction without creation (drug price increases with no improvements)

**Real-World Examples**:
- Diamond industry: De Beers artificially restricting supply
- Wine lists: Most expensive wine anchors everything else
- Amazon "Only 2 left" → week later still "only 2 left"
- Insulin price increases (5000% with no new research)
- Employer-tied health insurance trapping workers

**Practical Exercise**: Track daily pricing manipulations for one week

**Quiz**: 4 questions on anchoring, decoy effect, scarcity, rent-seeking

---

### Lesson 5: Digital Manipulation & Dark Patterns (120 min)

**Topics Covered**:
- 8 dark pattern types (confirmshaming, roach motel, forced continuity, etc.)
- Infinite scroll and attention capture mechanics
- Variable reward schedules (Skinner box for humans)
- Algorithmic amplification of outrage
- Defending your attention

**Key Concepts**:
- **Dark Patterns**: UI designed to trick users (8 types documented)
- **Infinite Scroll**: Removes natural stopping points, bypasses conscious decision-making
- **Variable Rewards**: Unpredictable rewards create strongest addiction
- **Algorithmic Amplification**: Outrage spreads 6x faster (more engagement = more ad revenue)
- **Attention Economy**: Your attention is the product sold to advertisers

**Dark Pattern Types**:
1. Confirmshaming ("No thanks, I don't want to save money")
2. Disguised ads (sponsored content looks like articles)
3. Roach motel (easy signup, difficult cancellation)
4. Forced continuity (free trial charges automatically)
5. Bait and switch (expecting X, getting Y)
6. Hidden costs (fees added at final checkout step)
7. Friend spam (uploads contacts, spams them all)
8. Privacy zuckering (tricking users into oversharing)

**Real-World Examples**:
- TikTok/Instagram infinite scroll perfection
- YouTube/Netflix autoplay (default = continue watching)
- Pull-to-refresh = slot machine gesture
- Facebook algorithm amplifying divisive content (more engagement)
- Gym membership cancellation requiring 45-minute phone call

**Defense Strategies**:
- Delete apps, use web (more friction)
- Disable notifications
- Grayscale mode (reduces appeal)
- Time limits with hard cutoffs
- Nuclear option: quit entirely

**Practical Exercise**: Screenshot every dark pattern for 3 days (most find 20-50 per day)

**Quiz**: 5 questions on dark patterns, infinite scroll, variable rewards, algorithms, roach motel

---

### Lesson 6: Counter-Manipulation Mastery (120 min)

**Topics Covered**:
- 10-Second Manipulation Check protocol
- Building manipulation immunity (7 factors)
- Teaching others (Socratic method)
- Creating manipulation-resistant systems
- The meta-game: seeing systems vs. individual tactics

**Key Concepts**:
- **10-Second Check**: Notice feeling → Ask 3 questions → Insert delay
- **3 Questions**: (1) Who benefits? (2) Why the rush? (3) What if I had more time?
- **7 Immunity Factors**: Reality anchors, clear values, low social proof susceptibility, patience, economic independence, information hygiene, meta-awareness
- **Socratic Teaching**: Questions, not declarations (lets people discover manipulation themselves)
- **Systems Thinking**: Seeing manipulation as system feature, not bug

**Pattern Layers**:
- Layer 1: Individual technique ("They're using scarcity")
- Layer 2: Combination pattern ("Scarcity + social proof + authority")
- Layer 3: System pattern ("This business model is extractive")
- Layer 4: Cultural pattern ("Society normalizes this manipulation")

**Manipulation-Resistant Systems**:
- **Organizations**: Transparency, anonymous feedback, rotating leadership, external audits, clear metrics
- **Personal**: Delete manipulative apps, 24-hour rule, trusted council, documentation, exit strategy
- **Communities**: Critical thinking education, diverse sources, fact-checking culture, public callouts

**After Mastery Options**:
1. Protect yourself (valid)
2. Teach others (scaling immunity)
3. Build alternatives (competing systems)
4. Reform existing (systemic change)

**Practical Exercise**: Full manipulation system analysis + teach one person using Socratic method

**Quiz**: 5 questions on 10-second check, immunity principles, Socratic method, systems vs. tactics, resistant systems
